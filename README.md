Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based API application that:

Fetches a random cat fact from an external API (https://catfact.ninja/fact).
Exposes two main endpoints:
/catfact: Returns a random cat fact.
/health: Returns a health check to ensure the application is running.
The application is containerized with Docker and can also be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm.

Installation
Local Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/catfact-app.git
cd catfact-app
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application Locally: To run the Flask app locally:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Docker Setup
Build the Docker Image: Make sure you are in the root of the project directory (where the Dockerfile is located).

bash
Copy code
docker build -t catfact-app .
Run the Docker Container: Run the container and map port 5000 from the container to the host:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 catfact-app
The application will now be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Stopping the Container: If you need to stop the Docker container, press CTRL+C or use:

bash
Copy code
docker ps  # To get the container ID
docker stop <container_id>
Kubernetes with Helm Setup
Install Helm (if you haven't already): Follow the installation instructions for Helm.

Create a Kubernetes Cluster: You can use a local cluster like Minikube or Kind, or a cloud-based solution like EKS or GKE.

Install the Application Using Helm:

bash
Copy code
helm install catfact ./charts
Verify the Deployment: To check that your app is running, you can use:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
Access the Application: If using Minikube or Kind, you may need to use port forwarding to access the app:

bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward svc/catfact-app 5000:5000
API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

GET /catfact: Returns a random cat fact from the CatFact API.

Example Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "fact": "Cats have five toes on their front paws, but only four toes on their back paws."
}
GET /health: A simple health check to ensure the application is running.

Example Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
Testing the Application
To test the application locally or in Docker, you can use curl or Postman to check the endpoints:

Health Check:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:5000/health
Get Random Cat Fact:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:5000/catfact
CI/CD with GitHub Actions
This project is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy the application.

Workflow Steps:

Build Docker Image: The workflow builds the Docker image on every push to the main branch.
Run Tests: Tests are run using curl or a similar tool to verify the application is responding.
Deploy to Kubernetes: The workflow also deploys the app to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
Check the Workflow:

The workflow runs automatically whenever you push code to GitHub.
You can see the status of the workflow in the Actions tab of the repository.

Notes:
Production Environment: This Flask app is intended for development and testing. For production use, consider deploying it with a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI, and use a reverse proxy like NGINX.
Docker Optimizations: Ensure that your Dockerfile is optimized for smaller image sizes and better performance in production.
Final Remarks
This README file provides a comprehensive guide to getting the application up and running in different environments (local, Docker, Kubernetes). Feel free to customize it further based on your specific setup and requirements!
